Protocol verifier, copyright INRIA-CNRS, by Bruno Blanchet,
Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre 2000-2021.

This package contains Windows executables, documentation, and examples
of a cryptographic protocol verifier. The material contained in this
package is under the GPL license (see file LICENSE). The verifier
is also available in source form.

This software can be used to prove secrecy, authenticity, equivalence 
properties of cryptographic protocols.

INSTALL

The installation of graphviz is required if you want to have a drawing 
of graphs representing attacks that ProVerif found. It can be downloaded from
        http://graphviz.org

The installation GTK+2.24 is required if you want to run the interactive
simulator proverif_interact. At
	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.24/
download gtk+-bundle_2.24.10-20120208_win32.zip
unzip it in the directory C:\GTK, and add C:\GTK\bin to your PATH.

* under Cygwin

Uncompress the binary and documentation archives using GNU tar:

	tar -xzf proverifbin2.04.tar.gz
	tar -xzf proverifdoc2.04.tar.gz

This will create a directory named proverif2.04 in the current directory.

* under Windows 

Uncompress the archives proverifbin2.04.tar.gz and 
proverifdoc2.04.tar.gz using Winzip, in the directory
of your choice. This will create a subdirectory named proverif2.04. 

The system can run under Windows, but it is not very Windows-friendly:
you have to use the command line to run the programs. Improving the interface
is on the to-do list...

USAGE

This software contains three executable programs, proverif, proveriftotex,
and proverif_interact. 

The program proverif takes as input a description of a cryptographic
protocol, and checks whether it satisfies secrecy, authenticity, or
equivalence properties. The description of the protocol can have
several different formats.  The recommended format is the typed pi
calculus format, which is a dialect of the applied pi calculus (Abadi
and Fournet, POPL'01).  The description of the protocol is first
translated into Horn clauses, then the core of the verifier is called.
This input format is documented in the file docs/manual.pdf
(found in proverifdoc2.04.tar.gz). Examples of protocol descriptions 
can be found in the examples/pitype subdirectory. 
To run these examples, use 
        ./proverif <filename>.pv
or if your filename does not end in .pv,
        ./proverif -in pitype <filename>
For example:
	./proverif examples/pitype/secr-auth/NeedhamSchroederPK.pv

Other input formats are documented in the file docs/manual-untyped.pv
Research papers can be downloaded at
	http://prosecco.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/publications/index.html
They are not included in the distribution because of copyright differences.
(You cannot redistribute these papers.)

The program proveriftotex takes as input a protocol description
and converts it into a LaTeX file. This is useful for including
protocols in research papers.

The program proverif_interact is an interactive simulator for ProVerif
scripts.

The script "test" runs several tests (cygwin only):
You can run them by
         ./test 
The output of these scripts is written in the directory tests. The
filename of the output is "typed" followed by the
date/time of the run.
